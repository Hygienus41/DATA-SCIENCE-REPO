    "# Your recent learnings\n",
    "\n",
    "When you left 16 hours ago, you worked on From Loose Code to Local Package, chapter 1 of the course Developing Python Packages. Here is what you covered in your last lesson:\n",
    "\n",
    "You learned about structuring imports in Python packages, focusing on how to organize and access different parts of a package efficiently. Key points include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal Imports: You discovered the importance of internal imports for connecting modules and subpackages within a package. This structure allows for easier access and management of package components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Absolute vs. Relative Imports: You learned the difference between absolute and relative imports. Absolute imports specify the full path from the package's root, making them explicit and preferred for clarity. Relative imports, indicated by dots, denote the current and parent directories, useful for shorter paths and avoiding long import statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importing Subpackages and Modules: You practiced importing subpackages into the package's __init__.py file and modules into the subpackage's __init__.py file. This approach enables users to access subpackage functionalities directly after importing the main package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exposing Functions to Users: You worked on making specific functions accessible to users by importing them into the __init__.py files at appropriate levels. This technique simplifies the user's path to access frequently used functions.\n",
    "For example, to expose the convert_unit() function from the impyrial/length/api.py module, you used a relative import in the impyrial/length/__init__.py file:\n",
    "\n",
    "* from .api import convert_unit\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson emphasized the practical aspects of package structuring for both ease of use and maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#The goal of the next lesson is to teach you how to distribute your Python package, enabling others to easily download and use it."

Licenses clarify the permissions given to others regarding the use, modification, and distribution of your code, which is crucial for open-source projects. You explored different types of licenses and the implications of choosing one over another.\n",

A README serves as the front page of your package when hosted online, providing essential information like the package's purpose, features, installation instructions, usage examples, contribution guidelines, and license information. You practiced writing Markdown to include titles, text formatting, links, and code samples, making your README informative and engaging.\n",

    "\n",
    "You learned about enhancing the quality of your Python package through testing. Testing is crucial as it helps identify bugs early, ensures your code works as expected after changes, and signals to users that your package is reliable. Key points covered include:\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of writing tests for each function in your package to catch bugs and build trust with your users. For example, if you have a function get-ends, you should write a test function that checks if get-ends returns the correct output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing tests in a separate directory within your package, mirroring the structure of your code directory. This organization makes it easier to manage tests and ensures a clear relationship between your tests and the code they are testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pytest to run all your tests at once. By navigating to the top directory of your package and running the pytest command, pytest searches for and runs all test functions, providing a summary of which tests passed and which failed.\n",

    "\n",
