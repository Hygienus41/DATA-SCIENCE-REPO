    "Since human beings aren't digital, they need an interface to interact with the operating system. The most common one these days is a graphical file explorer, which translates clicks and double-clicks into commands to open files and run programs. Before computers had graphical displays, though, people typed instructions into a program called a command-line shell. Each time a command is entered, the shell runs some other programs, prints their output in human-readable form, and then displays a prompt to signal that it's ready to accept the next command. (Its name comes from the notion that it's the \"outer shell\" of the computer.)\n",

    "the relationship between the graphical file explorer that most people use and the command-line shell is that they are both interfaces for issuing commands to the operating system. Both take the user's commands (whether typed or clicked) and send them to the operating system."

    "Special Paths: You explored special path notations like . (current directory), .. (parent directory), and ~ (home directory), which help navigate the filesystem more efficiently.\n",

    "* Navigating directories and files: You explored using ls -R for listing all files and directories recursively and learned about tab completion to speed up typing file paths.\n",

    "* Modifying command behavior with flags: The lesson covered how flags like -n in head -n 3 seasonal/summer.csv can alter a command's output, in this case, showing only the first three lines of a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Selecting columns from files: With cut, you found out how to extract specific columns from a file, which is particularly useful for CSV files. An example command is cut -f 2-5,8 -d , values.csv to select columns 2 through 5 and column 8.\n",

    "\n",
    "Environment Variables: Special variables always available in the shell environment, such as HOME for the user's home directory and PWD for the present working directory. You can list all environment variables with the set command.\n",

    "Creating Shell Variables: Assign values to names directly (e.g., training=seasonal/summer.csv) and access them using $ (e.g., echo $training).\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops for Batch Processing: You learned to use loops to process multiple files or variables in batch. For example, for filetype in gif jpg png; do echo $filetype; done prints each file type on a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Wildcards in Loops: Wildcards can automate file selection in loops, such as for filename in seasonal/*.csv; do echo $filename; done to print all .csv files in the seasonal directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Spaces in Filenames: Spaces in filenames can cause issues in shell commands. Use quotes to encapsulate filenames with spaces, like mv 'July 2017.csv' '2017 July data.csv'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple Commands in Loops: You can execute multiple commands within a single loop by separating them with semicolons, as shown in for f in seasonal/*.csv; do echo $f; head -n 2 $f | tail -n 1; done.\n",
